exception NotConvertible

(** One of the optimizations performed on the target code is
    uncurrying, meaning collapsing functions into n-ary functions and
    introducing a family of application operators that apply an n-ary
    function to m arguments in one go. This constant defines the
    maximum arity of functions, hence bounding the number of
    application operators required.

    BEWARE: changing the value of this constant requires changing
    nbe.ml accordingly to have at least as many abstraction
    constructors and application operators. *)
